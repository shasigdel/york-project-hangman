# Hangman Game 🎮

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a C++ console application where players guess the hidden word one letter at a time. 

## Features 🚀
- **Single Player Mode**: Guess a randomly selected word within 7 attempts.
- **Custom Word Categories**: Words include sports, fruits, animals, cars, and brands.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Real-time feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, with a visual hangman display.
- **Rulebook**: Accessible in the menu for easy reference.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. **Main Menu**:
   - Choose to start the game, view the rules, or exit.
2. **Gameplay**:
   - Guess the letters of a randomly generated word.
   - Each correct guess reveals the corresponding letter(s) in the word.
   - Each incorrect guess adds to the hangman graphic.
3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - A hangman graphic updates with every incorrect guess.
4. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends when all letters are guessed correctly or after 7 incorrect guesses.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **Standard Libraries**: `<iostream>`, `<string>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`, `<algorithm>` for core logic and randomization.
